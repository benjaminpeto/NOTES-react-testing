## Introduction to testing with [Jest](https://https://jestjs.io/)

Boilerplate code for a basic JS test.

> App.test.js
```javascript
test.('name of the test', () => {
  expect.(true).toBeTruthy();
})
```
  
  *An assertion is a boolean expression. It is used to test a logical expression. An assertion is true if the logical expression that is being tested is true.*



  ## Jest explained

Jest is a test runner library for JavaScript. It works with multiple libraries and frameworks such as Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue, etc.

* Zero config on most JS projects
* Tests are isolated to maximize performance
* Has great documentation and has entire toolkit in one place
* Runs previously failed tests first
* Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files
* No import needed to run tests
* Great CLI
